          <h3>Personal Reflection: My heart bleeds for design </h3> 
          <p>-Personal challenges aside, my skills as a learner and designer were tested in the days leading up to this assignment and the progress i managed to make in 6-7 days is a testament to this. I had to restart everything, my html was a mess, css was not as creative and interactive as i wanted it to be and there was the nw scope of adding javascript to every single page in some way. I feel this metric was vague, but doable. I wish we had received tutorial and application based teaching, my grievance is that id watch a tutorial about mathematic and then have to go to YouTube and, infamously, AI, to learn how to practically implement things. Things like the hamburger toggle menu, which for many was a nightmare, there I just decided to humble myself and seek assistance from AI. The results were good, and at the time of writing this i ahev yet to make sure that my website navigation is consistent by adding the menu to all my pages. Hopefully, my marks for responsiveness will increase </p>
          <p>Speaking of increasin marks, i hope the work i put into restructuring my html(from scratch) , css and even this reflection( for theory ) do not go unnoticed. I am proud of myself though, despite being unsure of whether or not i should consistently update the design section about what needs to change and the feedback received, the progression in the active development of my website from module 1 to 2 and to now is LARGE. Im kicking myself in the side for not having been motivated enough to start sooner, however, an important lesson about development, work ethic, resilience and collaboration has been learned. I hope these stick with me for the rest of my life and that the final website submission will surpass even my own expectations. </p>

          <h3>Portfolio mishap:</h3>
          <p>Its 11:31, and now my github wont work because the video files are too big sooo i deleted them for now. I will relink the videos later. Oh well. At least I have a working hamburger toggle menu that I need to configure for the other pages, but a win is a win </p>
          <h3> How my inability to make choices ruined my design (cognitive dissonance)</h3>

          <p>What matters now is keeping track of the new and the old, and knowing what needs to be changed for the final</p>

        <h2>Design Reflection: LATEST UPDATE:</h2>   <time datetime="2025-04-14"> 14 April 2025</time>
        <p>Yes, Ive moved things around</p>

        <img src="../Images/MoodBoard.jpg" 
        alt="Mood Board with various colours used for the site">

        <p>As you can see from the mood board above, this is the plan, or should i say...WAS the plan... </p>
        <p>Developing this website has been one long and humbling journey. I had big hopes for how everything would come together, but I have to be honest. I didn‚Äôt manage to 
          make everything work in time. There were ideas that got abandoned, features I couldn‚Äôt quite figure out, and plenty of technical challenges that forced me to simplify
          as deadlines approached. At one point, I even misplaced my Week 7 blog post in the wrong folder. That moment alone is proof that even when I try to be a perfectionist
          (sometimes lol), mistakes still happen.</p>
              
        <p>That being said, I‚Äôve learned so many important skills. I now understand how to use CSS grids, how to link and embed videos (even from external sources like Google
             Drive), how to clean up semantic HTML, and how to create better visual sections. I know the site might look totally different by the time the next submission rolls
              around. My website might do a whole 180..who knows (I should know, lmao)</p>
              
        <p>For the fonts, I chose a mix to reflect different aspects of the site‚Äôs tone and personality, just like my own disorganised personality. I used Fira Sans Condensed, 
          Great Vibes, SchoolBell, Oooh Baby, and Playfair Display. Some are bold and eye-catching, meant to grab attention quickly, while others offer easy legibility for reading 
          on web pages. The handwriting-style fonts like Oooh Baby help add a personal, playful touch and give the site a more informal, non-academic feel.</p>
              
        <p>The textured header was one of my bigger experiments. It adds visual interest, but honestly, I kind of regret putting it in. I haven‚Äôt figured out how to design custom 
            doorknob-shaped navigation buttons that would give the illusion of moving from page to page like a journey through rooms. If I can‚Äôt make that idea work later, 
            the header might need to go or be reworked.</p>
            
        <p>I also worked on visual hierarchy by making sure my headings stood out using larger font sizes, bold weight, and contrasting colours. This answers the prompt, 
            ‚ÄúHow will you ensure the headings stand out?‚Äù and I think it help make my style guide clearer and more practical for future editing.</p>
              
        <p>My use of semantic markup is improving. I‚Äôve been using tags like  main,  section,  article,in a more structured way. But I know that my overall information architecture 
            still needs more thought. I need to keep asking myself how users will move through the site and what kind of experience I‚Äôm designing for them.</p>
              
        <p>One big takeaway is that curation doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. I‚Äôve realised that in order for something to truly feel curated, it takes time, attention, and consistent 
            effort. That insight is going to change how I approach my interaction design process going forward. It‚Äôs not just about making it look good fast. It‚Äôs about making it 
            feel intentional.</p>

        <p>All in all, this phase wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs helped me build a foundation I can actually work from, and that‚Äôs more than enough for now.</p>
  
            <h2>Idea Version 1</h2>
            <h3>Documentation of My IxD (Interaction Design) process:</h3>
            <p> Interaction design focuses on making user experiences intuitive and easy. My process began by identifying the 
                emotions and reactions I want users to feel when interacting with my website. I want them to feel like they‚Äôve entered a 
                space that‚Äôs warm and familiar‚Äîalmost like visiting a friend‚Äôs house. The experience should feel seamless and effortless, 
                so I prioritized simplicity in navigation and interaction.</p>
    
            <p> I started with research into current design trends, particularly those that align with minimalism and a welcoming aesthetic. 
                I looked at user personas to help me map out the different types of people who would interact with the site: my peers, lecturers, and graduate 
                recruiters, and anyone interested in early website development. By understanding their needs, I was able to tailor the site‚Äôs flow, content, 
                and style to create an intuitive experience.
            </p>
    
            <p> From there, I sketched wireframes using simple apps on my iPad such as Notebook and Freeform. I must admit, they do need some refining 
                and user input to ensure that the website I end up designing is free from confusion and has clear usability.</p>
            
            <h2>  <h2>Goal Alignment:</h2>  

            <p>My primary goals for the website are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>  Usability:   Ensure every user can easily navigate through the pages.</li>
                <li>  Flow:   Create a smooth transition between pages that guides the user effortlessly from one point to the next.</li>
                <li>  Personalization:   Leave users with a sense of having met me and explored my academic and professional journey.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To achieve these goals, I focus on keeping the interface clean, the language conversational, and the overall design cohesive.</p>
            
            <h2>  <h2>Information Structure - Content Mapping:</h2>  </h2>
            <p>The website‚Äôs content structure is organized around key areas of my academic journey and professional interests. Each page serves a purpose:</p>

            <h2>Colour and Visual Aesthetic:</h2>
             
            <img src="../Images/Palette.png" 
            alt="Image of a colour palette with 6 colours and their hex codes and names"
            height="450"
            weight="500">


            <p>My color palette is designed to create a warm, inviting digital space.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>  Moss Green:   A grounding, calm base color.</li>
                <li>  White Smoke:   A neutral backdrop for readability.</li>
                <li>  Almond:   Warmth and coziness for a welcoming feel.</li>
                <li>  Pale Purple:   A subtle touch of creativity.</li>
                <li>  Isabelline:   A balanced, neutral shade.</li>
                <li>  Coyote:   A soft contrast for depth.</li>
                <li>  Sage Green (Potential Addition):   Enhances the natural aesthetic.</li>
            </ul>
            
              <p>Primary colour palette:</p>  
                <li>Moss Green: This earthy tone serves as the foundation of the website, symbolizing growth, balance, and calm. It creates a sense of stability and is easy on the eyes, making it perfect for larger background areas or sections that need a sense of depth.</li>
                <li>White Smoke: As a soft, off-white shade, it provides a neutral, clean backdrop that allows the other colours to pop without overwhelming the content. It enhances readability and makes the design feel airy and fresh, giving users a sense of openness.</li>
                <li>Almond: A cozy, beige-toned colour, almond adds a touch of warmth and comfort to the site. It‚Äôs ideal for background elements or sections where I want users to feel relaxed and at ease, reinforcing the home-like feel I aim to create.</li>
 

            <p>Secondary colour palette:</p>
                <li>Pale Purple (Pink): A gentle and creative tone, this colour is used sparingly to introduce warmth and a sense of nurturing. It helps highlight important elements, such as headings or buttons, and evokes a feeling of creativity and calm. The soft nature of this pink adds a touch of personality without being too bold.</li>
                <li>Isabelline: This warm, neutral shade of yellowish-tan provides balance and harmony. It complements both the moss green and white smoke, acting as a bridge between the more vibrant hues. Isabelline brings a calm, natural feel to the website, contributing to the overall serenity of the space.</li>
                <li>Coyote: This muted brownish-grey brings depth and reliability to the palette. It pairs well with the other earthy tones, providing a sense of grounding and security. Used for text or buttons, coyote adds a subtle contrast while maintaining the overall warmth of the design.</li>
                <li>Sage Green: As a potential addition to the secondary palette, sage green would enhance the natural and calming vibe of the site. It pairs beautifully with moss green, reinforcing the theme of growth and tranquility. It could be used to accentuate key design elements like navigation buttons or section headings, adding a fresh, refreshing pop without being overpowering.</li>
 
            <h3>Sketches and UI Overview:</h3></p>
            <p>I experimented with multiple homepage layouts and content structures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>    Portfolio Grid:   A structured display for projects.</li>
                <li>    Single-Column Blog Layout:   Focused on readability.</li>
                <li>    Basic UI Elements:   A navigation bar, central content, and footer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The final aesthetic balances minimalism with warmth, making users feel at home.</p>

            <p>BLUE, BLACK AFRO, DREAMY, RETRO FUTURISM...I might play around with these key words to inform my next theme...</p>
