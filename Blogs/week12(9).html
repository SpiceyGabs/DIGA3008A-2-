            <p>When I think about how my code matters in the context of decolonization, I realize it is not just about what I build, but how I build it and who it includes or excludes. In web development, we often use standard coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which were primarily developed in Western contexts. This means there can be an inherent bias in how these technologies are framed. For instance, CSS styling and layout conventions often prioritize aesthetics and functionality that are more reflective of Western tastes, potentially overlooking cultural differences in color usage, layout preferences, and even user navigation patterns.</p>

            <p>Decolonising code means disrupting norms that often cater to Western-centric aesthetics, interaction assumptions, or even access to fast devices and stable internet. As a South African student and aspiring web creator, I am becoming more conscious of these dynamics. For example, in my coding practice, I have noticed how easy it is to default to frameworks, libraries, or designs that are made with high-speed, visually heavy interfaces, which not everyone in our context can access. Decolonising design means thinking about accessibility, local context, user agency, and whose stories get told. Even the decision to write clearer, more semantic HTML is part of making sure assistive tech (eg, for screen readers: can users who rely on them navigate my site?)</p>

            <p>When I first started coding, I thought I was just building a “pretty” website. But now, I am realizing that every line of code carries power and my aesthetic is quite Eurocentric. Every design decision can either reinforce colonial patterns of exclusion or gently start to undo them. That is why I’m thinking more critically about what it means to decolonize design not just in the aesthetics but also in the logic, the layout, the interaction flow, and even my folder structures.</p>

            <p>Here's what I'm considering adding to my website with JavaScript:</p>

            <p>-Smooth Scroll and Scroll-Based Animations: Right now, my transitions between sections are quite abrupt. Adding smooth scroll effects would soften the experience, especially when users click nav links. Scroll-triggered animations could also help highlight key content as it comes into view such as like titles sliding in, or buttons pulsing/throbbing gently. It’s subtle, but it makes the site feel more alive and intentional.</p>

            <p>-Responsive Navigation Menu (for Mobile) and buttons in general: Currently, my site’s nav is always visible, even on smaller screens. With JavaScript, I could build a hamburger menu that expands and collapses on tap. Consulting with Iman helped me realize that this doesn’t just save space but also improves usability on devices like phones, making the design cleaner and more user-friendly.</p>

            <p>-Dynamic Content Cards (for the Portfolio or Blog Posts): Imagine hovering over a blog thumbnail and it gently expands or shows a short description. Or click a “See More” button and more content loads without reloading the whole page. JS can do that. It would make the blog and portfolio sections feel more interactive and less static. Ill add this on top of what I already have.</p>

            <p>-Light/Dark Mode Toggle (If I have time): Adding a theme toggle is an accessibility tool that’s becoming quite popular that I’d like to have a go at implementing.</p>

            <p>-Filters: One feature I might explore is filtering content with JavaScript. Right now, my blog posts and the videos in my portfolio are just stacked in a list, and this works for now, but isn’t super dynamic or helpful for users trying to find specific types of content. Filters would allow users to quickly sort and access what they’re looking for on each of these pages. I might also add a “show all” button.</p>

            <p>I recognize the ethical responsibility to create an inclusive space on my website. This goes beyond just being visually appealing; my design choices must also ensure that my website is accessible to a diverse audience, and with small but intentional choices, serves to decolonize the internet.</p>
