            <p>Setting up Github was fairly easy I have experience with it having worked with that last challenge my group project and to build games.
            The problem was creating my website through visual studio code and publishing to pages. 
            Im still experiencing issues but I managed to reach out to Iman and I’m currently working on that</p>
           
            <p> I chose to read the library of Babel because of the similarity to the story in the Bible called the tower of Babel,
            in which the people of the time we’re trying to build a building or skyscraper tall enough to reach the heavens and to see God. 
            To stop them, God created a confusion of language, 
            this meant that everyone spoke different languages and couldn’t understand each other and could not continue to build anything
           </p>
           
            <p>The library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, was an interesting read. 
            The reading speaks about a universe envisioned as a library that has all possible books. 
            The library is made up of hexagonal galleries that are linked by airshafts and low railings. 
            it then goes on to describe a very complicated system of organisation with each book having more than 400 pages each and it’s composition. 
            It is similar to the story of the tower of babel in that at the beginning people were happy to have a plethora of information at their 
            fingertips and a clear idea of the sharing of information, however as time went on that happiness soon turned into depression once they 
            realised that the precious books are inaccessible. Someone wanted to create canonical books by chance or others wanted to eliminate useless works. 
            And very much like how the people were building in vain in the Bible these people searched for “the man of the book” in vain.
           </p>
           <p>
            What does this have to do with my experience of the web? Well, I think most pursuits are in vain, most searches are done for fun,
            people do not really understand the gravitas of the situation of being able to have all and any knowledge at our fingertips.
            Much like what we discussed in class, human behaviour is predictable and doesn’t change especially when it comes to content. 
            </p>
            <p>Interesting things about the history of the web:
                I find it interesting how quickly removed on since the conception of the computer and the web to how we use it today, especially as gen z.
            </p>
            <p>Goals:I’m very excited for this course! My goals for this course are not only to create engaging an immersive web design and to become a better 
            user experience designer, but you also achieve the highest marks possible in this pursuit. I aim to read as much as possible and understand 
            the web outside of my lens as a user but also as a developer, seeing where it came from where it is now and where it is going in the future 
            as someone who aims to develop it to that end. I also wish to gain knowledge from the course and my peers and to share knowledge as well.
