    <h3>Ethics, UI, UX and Interaction</h3>
    <h4>Critically analysing a local website: Sorbet.com </h4>

        <p>User Interface and user experience design structure the interactions we have on the web. The way they are designed and work together to determine whether a website is intuitive, accessible, inclusive, responsive, and user-friendly. When designed thoughtfully, UI and UX work together to create seamless and ethical digital experiences. This essay will explore these principles through a critical analysis of “Sorbet”, a South African beauty and skincare website. We will explore and reflect on the ethics of their design choices and why these are important to consider during the design process, because these choices affect ethical engagement online. We will also look at the ethical implications of its interaction design, using Superbalist.co.za as a website from which we can affirm industry conventions, and contextualise Sorbet’s design decisions within online retail and its trends. Ultimately, the purpose of this essay is to analyse Sorbet’s digital presence, and whether it lives up to the ethical ideals of accessibility, inclusive design, and respect in the context of South Africa’s colourful digital landscape.</p>

        <p>User interface (UI) refers to the visual and interactive elements of a digital product that users see and interact with when using a digital product (<cite>Hamidli, 2023</cite>). In practice it includes typography, layout design, colour schemes, buttons and icons, and any other elements that are visible to the user with the goal of creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. This would allow users to navigate and interact with a digital product; it is essential. User experience (UX) refers to the journey of interacting with the digital product as a whole. Designers ask themselves, “How does the user feel using the product?”, and “How do they feel afterwards? Will they return?” This journey encompasses interaction from the initial discovery of the product to post-purchase support (<cite>Hamidli, 2023</cite>). Technically, this involves user flows, information architecture, usability testing and content strategy. (<cite>Hamidli, 2023</cite>). UI and UX work together to create successful and appealing user experiences, with the focus being on minimising the cognitive load of users when trying to accomplish their goals. Ethical design refers to the practice of creating digital experiences that respect the rights, needs, and well-being of users. It considers more than just functionality or aesthetics by asking questions along the lines of “who benefits from this design? who might be excluded?” and “how is power distributed in this interaction?” According to <cite>GeeksforGeeks (2022)</cite>, ethical UX design involves being transparent with users, prioritizing accessibility, and avoiding manipulative tactics like dark patterns. Ethical design also means making intentional decisions to support digital inclusion, protect user privacy, and promote fair, respectful online engagement across all devices.</p>

        <p>On Sorbet’s site, the intersection of UI, UX, and ethics becomes clear. With every click, colour, and layout choice, who feels seen, excluded, and who can fully participate in the digital beauty space is formed. Sorbet is a local brand with products and services within beauty, hair, and skincare. Established in 2005 by Ian Fuhr and currently owned by the Clicks Group, the brand has franchised and now has around 190 stores across the country, whilst also selling products through Clicks stores (<cite>Clicks Group, 2022</cite>). According to the website, Sorbet is presented as an accessible, nationwide beauty brand catering to diverse beauty needs, with a focus on customer empowerment, personal care and convenience.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this digital product is to create a welcoming and calming first impression while channelling users towards services and products. As seen in figure 1, the homepage of the Sorbet website immediately presents a large hero image featuring a smiling Caucasian woman, accompanied by bold text that serves as a central visual focal point. This image is placed at the top of the screen, establishing it as the most dominant element in the site’s visual hierarchy. The use of large-scale photography combined with minimal text is designed to draw the user’s attention and convey a sense of aesthetic appeal. However, while the image is polished and professional, its relevance to Sorbet’s core service offerings, which focus on hair, skin, and nail treatments, to me, feels disconnected. Given the nature of beauty services, which are deeply personal and highly tied to diverse skin tones, hair textures, and hand and body types, the homepage image may unintentionally set a narrow tone for different user expectations.</p>

        <p>As someone deeply engaged with beauty culture and content, I find the lack of inclusive representation at the first point of contact a bit concerning. This choice not only limits the emotional relatability for a broader audience but also misses an opportunity to visually communicate Sorbet’s potential for serving a wide range of customers. This is a design choice that raises questions about accessibility and inclusivity for broader audiences, although it is visually effective.</p>

        <p>The menu hierarchy looks straightforward. Unlike industry-standard designs that prioritise intuitive design, Sorbet’s navigation bar could benefit from clearer information architecture, it needs to clarify or indicate its dropdowns, which indicates that the navigation has more to show. This would help reduce cognitive load and improve the overall ease of access. In a way, the site expects users to already know where everything is in terms of what service they need the business to provide.</p>

        <p>Compared to sites like Superbalist, which follow more typical beauty website layouts, Sorbet’s menu feels on par for a website within this industry. It works, but it could do more to support the user’s journey. Superbalist’s homepage, as seen in Figure 2, also assumes that users know what it is that they came to the website for; there is no clear indicator that it is a clothing and retail website. This might limit usability for certain users. In terms of contrast and accessibility to users with disabilities (such as colour-blindness), according to WAVE contrast checker seen in figure 3 below, the website for Sorbet has poor contrast, with 35 contrast errors and a range of errors including empty links, long alternative texts, places where there is missing alternative text. Alternative text is important because it tells the blind or visually impaired user what an image is and what’s in the image. Screen readers read the alt text aloud so users can understand what the image is showing. Without it, all they would hear is “image”, which diminishes their experience on the site and on the web. The WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) require alt text as part of Level A compliance (<cite>Costanza-Chock, 2020</cite>).</p>

        <p>Ethics, within web design help make sure the internet is safe, accessible and inclusive for everyone. Accessibility is a major concern in UI/UX design for several critical reasons. Despite Sorbet’s sleek visual design, its site raises serious concerns around ethical UX and inclusive accessibility. Firstly, the site isn’t fully responsive. When I viewed it on my Apple widescreen, I had to manually resize text and layout elements just to navigate the page properly. This experience revealed a lack of fluid layout and viewport adaptability, both of which are essential for accessible, cross-device use (<cite>Hamidli, 2023</cite>).</p>

        <p>Whilst interacting with the website, I noticed a dark pattern: the website located a store “near me” without ever requesting access to my location. My device’s location settings were off, and I hadn’t been asked to accept cookies, which raises a clear ethical red flag about user consent and data privacy. This violates <cite>GeeksforGeeks' (2022)</cite> ethical UX principles, which prioritise transparency and user autonomy. Additionally, the site’s content reveals a lack of diverse representation, especially on the “Candi&Co” page. While this section appears to target people of colour, the product range and imagery often feel limited or tokenistic, failing to reflect the full spectrum of hair and beauty needs for Black users. I must admit, there was diversity on other pages, but not where it truly mattered. According to <cite>Costanza-Chock’s (2020)</cite> Design Justice principles, ethical digital design must prioritise those at the margins of society and not only include them just because they must, but design with and for them. Sorbet’s approach to inclusion, particularly on pages like “Candi&Co”, feels more like a gesture than a meaningful engagement. From a design justice perspective, this creates a digital space that prioritises some users while sidelining others. This practice reinforces exclusion rather than challenging it. Accessible and inclusive UI/UX isn’t just about good design; it’s about treating all users with fairness, dignity, and visibility.</p>

        <p>While Sorbet’s site reflects many visual strengths, it reveals gaps in ethical UX and inclusive design. The lack of accessibility, limited representation, and questionable data practices all point to missed opportunities for ethical engagement. In the context of South Africa’s unequal digital access, where many people experience the internet primarily through mobile or low-data interfaces, these oversights become ethical concerns. The website succeeds in creating a visually polished and calming aesthetic through its consistent colour scheme and smooth UI. The soft tones and clean layout make a strong first impression, aligning well with the brand’s intention to feel approachable and aspirational. Sorbet’s digital presence is visually appealing, and it reflects industry conventions seen in similar sites like Superbalist. However, as this analysis has shown, good visual design is only one part of an ethical digital experience. As a designer and user, this experience reminds me that mature design thinking is not just about how something looks, but about who it works for, and who it leaves behind.</p>
