                <p>I won't lie, I found the process of looking at a text for the purpose of drafting a close reading hefty. I've chosen to break down the reading from Greenstein et. al. on “How geography shapes the - and is shaped by - the internet.”</p>

                <p>The authors begin by challenging the popular notion that the Internet has caused the hardships of geography to be irrelevant, referring to this as the “death of distance”. The Internet may reduce costs related to communication, transportation, and information access, but these benefits aren’t evenly distributed. Certain areas remain disadvantaged, suggesting that rather than creating a level digital playing field, the Internet often reflects and sometimes amplifies existing inequalities across regions.</p>

                <p>The main idea here is that the internet does not flatten the world, but it highlights and accelerates the disparities that already exists between different places. Green et. al. argue that the idea of the “death of distance” is a myth, as geographic and socio-economic factors continue to shape the access and usage of the Internet.</p>

                <p>The authors also confirm that the www is an enhancement to the internet, and doesn’t replace it when they mention that “In the mid-1990s, the inter-networking infrastructure and protocols of the research community became available to private users. Known colloquially as the ‘Internet,’ and newly enhanced with the additional functionality of the World Wide Web…”​ (I thought this important to mention because all the things on the web need internet access, but not everything on the internet is seen or “hosted” via the web e.g: applications, messaging etc.)</p>

                <p>The tone, mood, structure, context and the form of the text:</p>

                <p> Tone:it feels academic and analytical. The text is written by economists and/or researchers, which makes sense because the text is evidence-heavy and feels well-edited and measured. This, whilst also being subtle and cautious, instead of making bold, outright claims, the authors are always qualifying what they say with “it depends” and “varies across locations.” They sound like what they are: professors who are debunking common myths with evidence, statistics, case studies and a lengthy number of references.</p>

                <p> Mood:Reflective Realism. As I read this, I felt that the text was serious and intentionally grounded. The text felt like a wake-up call, to another challenge of digitization. The Internet isn’t romanticized as a one size fits all solution for everything but, instead, it’s treated like a mirror that reflects pre-existing inequalities.</p>

                <p> The structure: the text is structured in layers. It starts broad with theory (like that about the “www” and “death of distance”), then it moves into what the Internet changes (costs, frictions). It then focuses on how those changes vary by location, firms, and individuals, before it ends with the consequences (inequality, innovation, etc.) The text reads like a carefully structured academic argument that builds from abstract theory to detailed case studies and ends with suggestions for future research. Conveniently, each section also begins with a claim or question, then backs it up with citations and data.</p>

                <p> The form:the form of the text is that of a scholarly book chapter in an economics handbook. It’s research-based, citation-heavy, and written for other scholars and academics. The text is meant to highlight, explain and create an academic finding about how geography interacts with digital infrastructure, whilst guiding future research and policies. Simply put, it's an academic literature review combined with an analysis of economic geography.</p>

                <p> Context: The text was published in 2018, after about two decades of global Internet growth at various rates in different parts of the world but long before the 2020 pandemic. There was also growing criticism of the idea that the Internet automatically levels the playing field (which is not true)</p>

                <p>A big part of the chapter focuses on “firms”(businesses) and how they adopt the Internet. The text outlines how firms in urban areas are more likely to implement digital tools because they have access to complements like third-party IT services or specialised employees. By contrast, small businesses in rural areas may need the Internet to overcome their isolation, but still struggle to adopt it due to high costs and lack of support. This contradiction creates what the authors call a “net benefit gap,” where those who might benefit most from the Internet are least able to use it effectively. The structure of the text mirrors this logic, moving from theoretical models to case studies, showing how large-scale infrastructure meets small-scale realities.</p>

                <p>Another key point in the text is that individuals, not just firms, are affected by geographic variance. Through studies of Internet adoption, the authors show that people are influenced by those around them. If your neighbours or coworkers are online, you're more likely to join them. Events like the pandemic accelerated this but also highlighted this problem. This makes internet adoption a social process as much as a technical one. The analysis of geography and the internet is not just confined to these things, but is also about power, place and privilege. By constantly returning to local contexts, they remind the reader that digital tools are never neutral; they are always shaped by the social, economic, and geographic worlds into which they’re dropped. This makes the chapter not just an analysis of digital economics, but a subtle critique of how modern technology often amplifies the inequalities we already live with instead of correcting them.</p>
