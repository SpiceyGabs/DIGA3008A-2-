            <p>From my understanding, when you write a critical reflection of a text, you need to introduce and contextualize the text, give my reflection on it and how it relates to my personal experiences and frame of reference, analyze the text for deeper learning, stating the arguments if there are any, and evaluate the text using evidence based critical thinking.</p>

            <p>Sheena Magenya’s text titled “Making a Feminist Internet in Africa”, uses evidence and critical thinking to critique the common conception that digital spaces are inherently equal and/or democratic. She challenges the reader to consider how the patriarchy, capitalism and colonialism shape who gets to be seen, safe and heard online. These statements are backed by evidence through the data. Magenya notes that between 2015 and 2019, Kenya gained 15 million new internet users. This is a staggering increase, and the figure suggests significant progress in people being able to access the internet. She does not rush to celebrate this information, but rather interrogates it, asking questions surrounding the identity of these new users, their safety, and their voice, all to remind us that access doesn’t always mean equity, and that their presence doesn’t immediately translate into power. Also, she notes that the increasing number of internet users doesn’t necessarily suggest that marginalised groups, mainly queer, disabled and African women and people, are better represented online. And I agree with this because most internet structures and applications are modelled using Eurocentric standards that do not hold space for African stories, experiences or consider how someone from Africa might use and might want to navigate the internet differently to someone from Europe.</p>

            <p>Magenya’s essay pushed me, as a young, black, African women, to start questioning what I’ve accepted as normal, to take up more space online on my terms, and to actively seek out and support African feminist content. At its core, the text exposes the myth that the internet is a democratic, equalising space. Magenya challenges the reader to come to terms with the reality that the internet, like offline society, is shaped by various power imbalances. I’ve never really thought about how representation and access are linked. If we do not see good things happen to marginalised groups online, how will we believe they are possible? Her critique of technology as a tool “we use to survive, not to play” hit me hard. I use the internet for school and entertainment daily. However, why is using the internet for pleasure still a privilege elsewhere?  Magenya makes a demand for the internet to/that makes room for “more glitter and ochre” is a call for an internet that affirms multiplicity, complexity, and joy, rather than one that flattens or polices difference.</p>
