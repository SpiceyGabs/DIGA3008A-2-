    This week, I started exploring potential websites for my UI/UX analysis essay, and it definitely opened my eyes to how differently design functions across different industries.
        </p>

        <p>I eventually focused on 
            <a href="https://sorbet.co.za" 
            target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener">sorbet.co.za</a> for my main analysis. It stood out because of its clean visuals, targeted branding, and user experience that really reflects its identity as a self-care and beauty brand. There were some clear UX gaps I wanted to explore, especially around accessibility and mobile responsiveness, so it made a strong case for my final critical analysis.
        </p>

        <p>Before choosing it as my final analysis though, I also looked at:
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://netflorist.co.za" 
            target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener">netflorist.co.za</a>: I liked how bright and bold it felt, but the UI felt cluttered at times, and I noticed the navigation wasn’t always intuitive. Some pages also felt overloaded with content.
        </p>

        <aside>
            <img src="../Images/Netfloristimage.png" 
                alt="NetFlorist website screenshot" />
        </aside>

        <p><a href="https://zeitzmocaa.museum" 
            target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener">zeitzmocaa.museum</a>: Super sleek and minimalist. Visually, it was stunning, but maybe a bit too minimal—especially when it came to guiding user interaction or ensuring accessibility for different users.
        </p>

        <aside>
            <img src="../Images/ZeitsMOCAAimage.png" 
            alt="Zeitz MOCAA website screenshot" />
        </aside>

        <p>Each of these websites had unique strengths and weaknesses, but in the end, Sorbet gave me the widest areas to explore both within aesthetic design and ethical UX considerations.
