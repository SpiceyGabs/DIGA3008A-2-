    <h4>Week 14: The way I approach justice and ethics in my artistic and programming practice.</h4>
      <p>As I said in my previous blog post on ethical internet, I think the internet should be a place where everyone can use it safely and freely and be represented within those spaces. The internet isn’t just a tool, it’s a social space where our creations can do good or harm depending on how we share the art, what art we share and how it is received. After all, what we create affects real people behind every screen. Thoughtful, justice-centred practices help protect under-represented voices, making our work more meaningful. </p>
      <p> I don’t prompt AI for art, have not used AI-generated art or intend to participate in AI-generated art or AI filter-based trends on social media. I also don’t feed any artist’s work into AI generators as this is a form of exploitation, worse when it is done without the artist's permission.If I am inspired by something, which is often on Pinterest, I have a board with all my references to credit the artist. Otherwise, credit is a major thing when it comes to ethical design. Otherwise, it's important to learn from other artists, implementing their methods of design justice whilst also giving credit where it's owed.I use software such as Blender, Procreate and Krita in my digital artistic processes, these are simply tools, and I don’t intend to become fully dependent on them as my means of artistic expression. I still believe in using traditional mediums, such as paint(though its expensive, its my favourite), and other physical mediums</p>

      <p>I've started doing research into design justice using designjustice.org. They offer resources such as podcasts, newsletters and articles and free guides that teach people how to centre justice in any design project.  </p>
      <p>One thing I've noticed is that this year I've been using AI like a tutor, especially for executing specific functions in code. Though this does pose a threat to humans as It eliminates the element of “struggle” when learning something new, I find it quite useful in helping me get to the point quickly so that I have time to focus on other things. In my previous assignment submission, I wasted a lot of time trying to get my website banner to fit my page proportionally, for decorative things like animations to work, and trying to thoroughly understand what it was that I was doing and how it impacted the final product of my website. I feel like if I had used AI to help me solve problems in my code sooner, whilst also staying up to date with course content (despite my peers complaining, rightfully so, that there is a disconnect between the course content and what is expected from us in our assignments), I would’ve had more time to improve my website. I think what I eventually came to do was good, though, in that I would code first, then ask AI for suggestions on how to improve my code or the formatting.  </p>
      <p>Lastly, as an artist, it's important to know what types of challenges other people are facing on the internet and in the professional sectors, as someone who will be entering the employment sector very soon. The Goethe Institute also does a good job at not only keeping artists informed about such challenges but also hosting in-person events and industry talks where game designers and artists can come and talk about what they're doing and convey crucial industry-specific information(such as job listings, conventions, etc.)   </p>
