            <p>I think what an “ethical internet” looks like to me is one where everyone (all users, including children and people who are underrepresented or belonging to disadvantaged groups) can use the internet without having to keep an eye open for malice, scams, traumatic and graphic content, false information, propaganda, and where everyone is “safe”. Ethics are principles we use to decide whether things are right and wrong or good and evil. They help us, as people and as humans think about why we do what we do and how it affects the next person.</p>

            <p>Drawing on the concept of design justice and the values at play (VAP) methodology, an ethical internet would be one where values like equity, social justice, privacy, access, autonomy, and sociality are deliberately incorporated into its architecture and features. (Orgad, 2007) This would involve a structured design process with three iterative activities including discovery, translation, and verification. This model helps developers design an ethical internet instead of simply attaching a “privacy policy” to a product after it launches.</p>

            <p>Discovery involves figuring out which values matter for the project. This includes thinking about what the project is trying to do, who it affects, the design team’s background, and the bigger social or political context it's being built in.</p>

            <p>Translation means that these identified, abstract values are transformed into actual features and code. This also involves testing and iteration to make sure these values are well implemented in the code and are visible in the final product. And, when values clash, the team must find smart compromises or even redesign parts of the system. (eg; when certain privacy policies make things harder to use)</p>

            <p>Verification is about checking if the finished design/product actually reflects the values it set out to support. This step uses testing methods and feedback loops to make sure it’s not just ethical in theory, but in practice too.</p>

            <p>If we look at this from the perspective of communication-centred democratic theory, a truly ethical internet should work like a digital public sphere. This means a place where everyone can participate, speak freely, and access information without interference from governments or corporations, where public expression is a right, and not a privilege controlled by whoever owns the platform.</p>

            <p>Right now, most of the internet is legally treated like it is private property and not public space. Courts usually side with platform owners instead of the users, which means our ability to speak and share things online is always at risk of being limited or removed. To change this, we need both ethical design and legal change.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, I think the authors of the sources can agree that an ethical internet is one where power should shift away from those who own digital spaces, and more to the people who live and learn through these spaces. We need systems that are designed with care, responsibility, and justice at their core, and that don’t just look ethical on the surface whilst unethical practices and exploitative things are occurring behind the scenes.</p>
