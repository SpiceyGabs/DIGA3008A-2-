            <p>  Reflection of the reading: </p>
            <p> Reading the words on the screen and understanding the system behind them: Secondary literacy. 
            It’s the awareness and ability to recognize these things on our own. The utopian dreams vs 
            dystopian realities of technology through the web are a recurring theme within the reading. 
            Moulthrop touched on how technology can be used to manipulate people. He is aware of its 
            “co-operative” characteristics. That hypertext can not only make us vulnerable to various power 
            dynamics but through it, we can be made aware of them as well. Hypertext seems to be the way to 
            know whether we, consumers, are being manipulated.  The way he touches on the tension between 
            liberation and control, for me as a consumer, is a bit scary. </p>
        
            <p>When it comes to Moulthrop's predictions about the web and internet today he seems extremely 
            ahead of his time, considering that he published this in 1991, before mainstream hypertext. 
            The struggle with technology today is that it has lived out things from both the utopian and 
            dystopian ideations that Moulthrop, where the internet is this huge network of editable 
            information that is available to everyone but at the same time is also used for the surveillance 
            of consumers through third-party viewers or just bigger tech-based companies in general.  
            Technology, unfortunately, is never neutral. The best we can do is use the internet honestly, and 
            lobby for transparency from big companies into their usage so that hypertext does not become a 
            “beefed up” tool for manipulation. Moulthrop says to be vigilant of the systems shaping our online 
            experiences.</p>

            <p>Folder structure and URL scheme:</p>
            <p> <li>My folder structure is as follows: C:\3rd year IM\DIGA3008A </li></p>
    
            <p>Here, I have 1 CSS and 1 JavaScript file set up and ready for code to be tested and implemented 
            whenever possible. In the future, I plan to have new files every week, although I’ve heard 
            whispers of setting up my files in this way to be extra work, but without a clear example of 
            this, I think separating the files and their respective CSS and java folders will keep things 
            neat. I think it will also help me get used to setting up folders, navigating files, and keeping
            my code concise. I acknowledge that may be wrong, I will consult, and I am open to suggestions.
            </p>

            <p><li>URL scheme: DIGA3008A/Blogs/Week2.html</li></p>
            This just makes the most sense in terms of the blog page, and the way my files are set up. It 
            would mean that every week would need a new page altogether. 
            </p>

            <p> My wireframe idea: </p>
             <p><img src = "../Images/WireframePicture1.png" 
                    Alt= "An image of a wireframe"
                    title="Homepage wireframe"                  
                    Height="350"
                    Width= "350">  
            </p>
    </aside>           

            <p> I would like to explore this type of web page layout. It makes use of interactive elements such as 
            panels, and scrolling, and I would like to include a simple and short introduction on the home page. 
            I like this idea because it is simple. As time goes on, and we learn more about developing interactive 
            media, our blogs and websites will become more complex. For now, I'd like to show this gradual progression. 
            People's eyes naturally move in a z when reading things online and I think this layout presents the information 
            in a way that they can see and receive as much information as possible. Although I didn’t write it out on the 
            wireframe, I would like for the weekly blog panels to expand and fit the whole lower middle and right spaces, 
            making it easier to read.

            <p>-Cartoon Network website: https://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/show/we-baby-bears
            I really like how they’ve used colour, their characters and art within the negative spaces to create a very 
            interactive website. Each panel takes you to a different page within the site and their use of shapes when it 
            comes to the various cards is very intuitive.  As a user, I had a positive experience using this site.</p>

        <p>I feel that there are things they could change here and I find that important to note, that not all websites 
            are perfect. This one feels rigid and could use a way to make website visitors feel free to explore the page.
        </p>

            <p>What does my interaction with the World Wide Web (www) mean to me? </p>
            <p> Well, in context to hypertext, it would mean me actively exploring and making links rather than passively 
            receiving information. This symbolizes freedom to me, although what I do with that freedom is limited. I 
            can only make things based on what I know. I do consider myself a passive user of the web though, I mostly 
            use the www within the parameters of social media applications and watch videos from YouTube. Little 
            interaction is needed to have a good time online.
