        <div class="e-content" >              
                <p>For this week's discussion board post, I’ve decided to look at an article on digital inclusion as well as a text by author Claire Daniolou titled “The Need for Global Inclusion.”</p>
                <p>
                Daniolou (2020) explains that internet access is becoming a basic need in modern society. We saw this especially during crises like COVID-19, where work, education, and healthcare were all moved online. Without digital access, many communities, especially in rural or poor areas, were left out of various essential digital systems (like the COVID live stats app, the website that showed how many people were infected etc.), deepening existing inequalities.

                This shows how the digital divide isn’t just about having a device or a connection — it’s layered. It includes things like affordability, digital literacy, local infrastructure, and whether the content online actually speaks to people’s realities. Daniolou also warns that a lack of digital presence can lead to social and economic marginalization.
                </p>
                <p>
                Despite this, just getting people online isn’t enough. If digital tools are made for wealthy, urban users in the Global North, they won’t meet the needs of people in places like rural South Africa or be catered to their level of understanding and learned interaction practices. That’s why ethical design must go further and consider who current systems are excluding and how they can include them better.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Digital Inclusion page (n.d.) shares this concern, describing that access to digital technology could be a civil rights issue. It shows how people without access fall deeper into poverty. However, it still focuses more on getting people connected than on the actual design of platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                To make real change, digital systems must be made with diverse users in mind. This means considering their languages, contexts, and ways of learning. True inclusion means access plus education plus thoughtful, inclusive design.
                </p>
                <p>
                During the COVID‑19 pandemic, digital technology became essential for work, education, and healthcare, but without universal access, affordable devices, and digital literacy, marginalized groups were left further behind. Looking at it from a local perspective, in South Africa at the start of 2024, an estimated 45.34 million people (74.7% of the population at the time) had internet access, leaving 15.35 million (the other 25.3%) offline. By early 2024, the country logged 118.6 million active smartphone connections. This shows that mobile devices and smartphones are everywhere — even if not everyone knows how to use one effectively. Regardless, South Africans rely heavily on the internet and mobile connection.
