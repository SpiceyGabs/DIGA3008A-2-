    <h3>Scrambling the internet</h3>
    <h4> A reflection on the intersections between the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality</h4>

    <article class="h-entry">   
        <div class="e-content" > 
<p>The Berlin conference of 1884-1885, also known as the “Scramble for Africa”, was a meeting where the European powers of that time formalised the claiming of territory within the African continent. The continent was divided, and jurisdictional power was legalized, setting the stage for colonialism. (Rwigema, 2025) The effects of colonialism and its repressive legacy can still be seen in today’s digital age. Where powers fight to divide, conquer and control the elements that make the internet accessible and “free” for all. On the 9th of October 2024, the Republic of Mozambique hosted its most recent general elections to select its President, provincial assemblies and members of its unicameral Assembly. Following an unfavoured result, citizens protested, prompting a nationwide internet blackout and further escalation through military deployment in the capital, Maputo. (eNCA, 2024) Mozambique’s military crackdown and internet blackouts will be used to show how geopolitical strategies and digital coloniality intersect within the global internet ecosystem. </p>

<p>Digital coloniality refers to how the longstanding patterns of colonialism that are characterized by power imbalances and exploitation are reproduced intensively within modern digital technologies. (Magenya, 2020) These technologies, including the internet and artificial intelligence(AI), are not neutral “tools” but are active extenders of extractive practices online and digitally. Data and personal information, including photos, texts, and user behaviour, are collected on a massive scale by companies or AI systems. This data is seen as valuable, like oil or mineral commodities, that can be extracted and sold or used to generate profit. This often happens without people fully understanding or agreeing to how their data is used. (Crawford, 2021) (Lutz, 2019) Gathering and storing this data requires huge amounts of energy and resources (like mining minerals for hardware), which harms the environment. The negative effects impact poorer communities, and individuals with the least power. The hidden labour that supports AI systems, sometimes referred to as “ghost work” or “fauxtomation”, is often underpaid and monitored. (Crawford, 2021) </p>

<p>However, digital coloniality and geopolitical strategies extend across the broader internet as well, not just AI systems. This also reflects the broader dynamics of exploitation and alienation within digital economies. Data extraction is both an environmental and social issue, and AI’s “automation” often depends on hidden, exploited human labour. (Crawford, 2021) Digital coloniality is about platform control at the expense of those with less power. </p>
<p>My sources have a view from the perspective of AI. They iterate that geopolitical strategies in the context of AI involve deliberate efforts by states and corporations to secure power and dominance through technological innovation, resource acquisition, and pervasive surveillance. The drive to achieve AI dominance is framed as a “colonizing impulse,” where industry leaders seek to computationally map the entire planet and set up a centralized, authoritative worldview (Crawford, 2021). This race for AI superiority, particularly between global powers like the United States and China, is often described as an “AI war” focused on military and corporate advantage (Crawford, 2021). AI technologies, rooted in their military origins, now serve as key instruments of state power, extending surveillance and data extraction beyond intelligence agencies into local government functions such as law enforcement and welfare management. Blurred state-corporate boundaries intensify social inequalities through comprehensive information control. </p>
<p>The recent events in Mozambique, where they saw internet blackouts and militia following contested election results, are an excellent illustration of the implications of the intersection of geopolitical strategies and digital coloniality. The use of internet shutdowns as a tool to suppress the objections of the very same citizens who hold the power to vote, and who are politically invested, reflects how state power, boosted by advanced technologies, can be used to assert and keep political dominance. (Crawford, 2021) The assertion of this dominance exemplifies how digital infrastructures are not neutral and can at any moment become both the weapon and a battleground where control over information and populations is contested. </p>

<p>Mozambique’s crisis also reveals how geopolitical strategies often disproportionately affect marginalized populations. Many countries in the global south rely on infrastructure, platforms, and services owned by entities in the global north, which leaves them vulnerable to both external influence and internal misuse. The blackout and military response demonstrate how technology, through AI, social media platforms, or the internet itself, which was originally developed within dominant global powers' frameworks, was- and can continue to be repurposed to enforce local power, thus reinforcing existing inequalities and limiting citizens’ digital rights and freedoms. </p>

<p>I chose this case study due to personal experience. To this day, I find it difficult to find specific details around what insighted protest action, citizens personal accounts and what repercussions the government should be facing given they take any responsibility or accountability for election rigging. It didn’t make sense how silent social media such as twitter( currently known as X) and even TikTok were on the issue. All these platforms are connected through the people that post on them, and they are well within their rights to do so. </p>

<p>The global internet ecosystem refers to the vast, interconnected system of technologies, infrastructures, labour, data, and power relations that sustain the internet and its associated digital technologies across the globe. It is everything from cloud computing and AI systems to social media platforms and digital surveillance. All of which are linked. The term “ecosystem” is used to deliberately emphasize the interdependence and dynamic nature of the system. The global internet relies on information and resources that flow, feedback loops. (Greenstein et al, 2018) The system is embedded in our social realities as well as mined materials such as lithium and other rare earth materials acquired through mining (Crawford, 2021) </p>

<p>Despite the “death of distance model”,  which says that the internet reduces the importance of geographical factors in economic activity (Greenstein et al, 2018, p. 3), I, someone in a neighbouring country, felt very far and even removed from the political occurrences of the republic. I can only imagine how far removed from the world citizens and journalists felt. Accessing and making use of the internet has become a part of daily human life. The internet does a lot to remove challenges, such as transport, to connect with people. The elimination of these geographical challenges creates an ecosystem, and framing it as an ecosystem emphasises that it is almost alive, functioning like it is a living socio-technical formation shaped by power, extraction, and uneven global relations  (Lutz, 2019)(Magenya, 2020). </p>

<p>I suppose something that may be amplifying these problems, or perpetuating systems of inequality could be the lack of access to the internet in the first place. The UN Human Rights Council has affirmed that “the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online”, emphasizing that access to the internet is a fundamental human right integral to freedoms of expression and information. (Howell and West, 2016) In its 2021 resolution, the council explicitly and directly condemned censorship and internet shutdowns, urging governments to avoid deliberately disrupting online access. (Howell and West, 2016)This positions digital access not as a luxury, but as essential to civic participation and democratic life. </p>

<p>Your geographic position directly affects what protests are reported and how much information you can access. Studies show that areas with better broadband connectivity enable greater protest reporting, while under connected regions stay invisible. Mozambique’s election-related internet shutdown is not merely a domestic issue; it reflects a global struggle over digital control, one that echoes colonial history and projects it into digital futures, regardless of where someone is in the world, as someone looking in or someone experiencing the power struggle first hand. </p>
